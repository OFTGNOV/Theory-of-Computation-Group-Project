## 📘 Project Summary: Syntax Checker for a Simple Programming Language  

### **What We Are Creating**
- A **syntax checker** for a small, well-defined programming language.  
- Built using **Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)** and parsing techniques.  
- Designed to validate whether input programs/documents are syntactically correct.  
- Mirrors real-world applications in **compiler design, interpreters, IDEs, and markup validators**.  

### **Expectations**
- Work in **groups of 3–4 students** (no individual submissions).  
- Demonstrate mastery of **Theory of Computation concepts**, including:
  - Grammar design (terminals, non-terminals, production rules).  
  - Ambiguity analysis and its impact on parsing.  
  - Parser implementation (top-down or bottom-up).  
  - Grammar normalization (conversion to Chomsky Normal Form).  
- Show ability to:
  - Accept valid inputs and reject invalid ones.  
  - Generate parse trees or derivations.  
  - Provide meaningful syntax error messages.  
  - Document theoretical principles clearly.  

### **Deliverables**
1. **Grammar Specification**  
   - Terminals, non-terminals, production rules, start symbol.  
   - Ambiguity discussion with examples.  

2. **Parser Implementation**  
   - Source code in any language.  
   - Clear instructions for running the parser.  

3. **Test Suite**  
   - Valid examples (accepted).  
   - Invalid examples (rejected, with explanations).  
   - Logs/screenshots of parser output.  

4. **Written Report**  
   - Grammar design and justification.  
   - Ambiguity analysis.  
   - Parsing approach and algorithm.  
   - CNF conversion steps.  
   - Parse trees/derivations for sample inputs.  
   - Discussion of correctness and limitations.  

5. **Interview & Demonstration (Week 13)**  
   - Explain grammar and parsing logic.  
   - Demonstrate syntax checker.  
   - Answer theoretical and implementation questions.  

### **Assessment Criteria**
- Grammar accuracy and completeness (25%).  
- Parser correctness and robustness (30%).  
- Theoretical justification (ambiguity, CNF, parsing) (25%).  
- Report quality and test cases (15%).  
- Interview/presentation (5%).  

### **Important Notes**
- **No automatic parser generators** (e.g., ANTLR, YACC, Bison).  
- External libraries allowed only for basic tasks (must be documented).  
- Strict adherence to academic regulations (plagiarism rules apply).  
- **Late submission penalties**:  
  - 10% deduction (within 24 hours).  
  - 20% deduction (24–48 hours).  
  - Zero mark if more than 48 hours late.

✅ In short: We are building a **custom parser and syntax checker** from scratch, proving our grasp of CFGs, parsing methods, and grammar transformations. The deliverables are both **technical (code, test cases)** and **theoretical (report, interview)**, with marks spread across design, implementation, and explanation.
